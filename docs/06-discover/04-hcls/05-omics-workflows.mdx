Omics Workflows enables processing genomics data using user defined workflows described in WDL or Nextflow. A single invocation of a workflow is called a run, and a single process within a run is called a task.
Users have to upload a zip file containing the Workflow definition file(s) and Omics Workflows will automatically provision and scale the underlying infrastructure for running their bioinformatics workflow.
A workflow can be run on genomics data stored in an Amorphic dataset or in an Omics Sequence store.

:::info Note
To use Omics Workflows, HCLS should be enabled in the environment.

## How to create an Omics Workflow?

1. Goto Discover -> HCLS and Click on `+ Create Omics Workflow`
2. Upload a zip file containing the Workflow definition file(s).
3. Fill in the required fields (Details listed below)

| Properties | Details |
|----------|----------|
| Workflow Name | A name for the Omics Workflow. Workflow Name should only contain 1-128 alphanumeric, - & \_ characters. |
| Omics Workflow Engine | The desired workflow definition engine: WDL or Nextflow|
| Description | Description of the workflow being created. |
| Entry Point | An optional attribute which specifies which file should be the entry point for workflow execution. |
| Storage Capacity | Desired storage capacity for the workflow, can be between 1-20,000 GB. |
| Keywords | Keywords indexed & searchable in app. Choose meaningful keywords to flag related workflows & easily find them later. |
| Dataset Read/Write Access| Specifies which all datasets the workflow needs Read/Write access to respectively.|

:::info Note
Atmost 1 dataset can be specified for write access. If it is specified, worklow output will be written to this dataset.
