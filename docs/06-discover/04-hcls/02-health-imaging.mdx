-   If the user is an existing user then, the user will be taken to the
    application homepage immediately upon the login.

-   If the user is a newly registered user then, the user is required to
    agree to the 'Terms and Conditions' bound to the Amorphic application.
    User can move forward into the application only if the user agrees
    to those 'Terms and Conditions'. Once it is done, User will be
    provided with a set of credentials which can be used to connect to
    the Data warehouse (Ex: Redshift, AuroraMySQL). User should save those
    credentials. If not, the user can always reset the DWH(Datawarehouse)
    password using the 'Reset Password' button in the
    [Reset DWH Password](../home/profile-and-settings/other-settings#dwh-password) popup on the Settings Page.
